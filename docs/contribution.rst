Contributing to django-filer-gallery
##########################

Like every open-source project, django-filer-gallery is always looking for motivated
individuals to contribute to it's source code.
However, to ensure the highest code quality and keep the repository nice and
tidy, everybody has to follow a few rules (nothing major, I promise :) )

*************
In a nutshell
*************

Here's what the contribution process looks like, in a bullet-points fashion, and
only for the stuff we host on GitHub:

#. django-filer-gallery is hosted on `GitHub`_, at `fork`_
#. The best method to contribute back is to create an account there, then fork
   the app. You can use this fork as if it was your own project, and should
   push your changes to it.
#. When you feel your code is good enough for inclusion, "send a `pull
   request`_", by using the nice GitHub web interface.


*****************
Contributing Code
*****************

Getting the source code
=======================

- Code *must* be tested. Your pull request should include unit-tests (that cover
  the piece of code you're submitting, obviously)
- Documentation should reflect your changes if relevant. There is nothing worse
  than invalid documentation.
- Usually, if unit tests are written, pass, and your change is relevant, then
  it'll be merged.

Since we're hosted on GitHub, django-filer-gallery uses `git`_ as a version control system.

The `GitHub help`_ is very well written and will get you started on using git
and GitHub in a jiffy. It is an invaluable resource for newbies and old timers
alike.


Syntax and conventions
======================

We try to conform to `PEP8`_ as much as possible. A few highlights:

- Indentation should be exactly 4 spaces. Not 2, not 6, not 8. **4**. Also, tabs
  are evil.
- We try (loosely) to keep the line length at 79 characters. Generally the rule
  is "it should look good in a terminal-base editor" (eg vim), but we try not be
  [Godwin's law] about it.


Process
=======

This is how you fix a bug or add a feature:

#. `fork`_  on GitHub.
#. Checkout your fork.
#. Hack hack hack, test test test, commit commit commit, test again.
#. Push to your fork.
#. Open a pull request.


Tests
=====

Having a wide and comprehensive library of unit-tests and integration tests is
of exceeding importance. Contributing tests is widely regarded as a very
prestigious contribution (you're making everybody's future work much easier by
doing so). Good karma for you. Cookie points. Maybe even a beer if we meet in
person :)

Generally tests should be:

- Unitary (as much as possible). I.E. should test as much as possible only one
  function/method/class. That's the 
  very definition of unit tests. Integration tests are interesting too
  obviously, but require more time to maintain since they have a higher
  probability of breaking.
- Short running. No hard numbers here, but if your one test doubles the time it
  takes for everybody to run them, it's probably an indication that you're doing
  it wrong.

In a similar way to code, pull requests will be reviewed before pulling
(obviously), and we encourage discussion via code review (everybody learns
something this way) or IRC discussions.

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests simply execute ``runtests.sh`` from your shell. To make sure
you have the correct environment you should also provide the ``--rebuild-env``
flag, but since that makes running the test suite slower, it's disabled by
default. You can also see all flags using ``--help``.


**************************
Contributing Documentation
**************************

Perhaps considered "boring" by hard-core coders, documentation is sometimes even
more important than code! This is what brings fresh blood to a project, and
serves as a reference for old timers. On top of this, documentation is the one
area where less technical people can help most - you just need to write a
semi-decent English. People need to understand you. We don't care about style or
correctness.

Documentation should be:

- We use `Sphinx`_/`restructuredText`_. So obviously this is the format you should
  use :) File extensions should be .rst.
- Written in English. We can discuss how it would bring more people to the
  project to have a Klingon translation or anything, but that's a problem we
  will ask ourselves when we already have a good documentation in English.
- Accessible. You should assume the reader to be moderately familiar with
  Python and Django, but not anything else. Link to documentation of libraries
  you use, for example, even if they are "obvious" to you (South is the first
  example that comes to mind - it's obvious to any Django programmer, but not to
  any newbie at all).
  A brief description of what it does is also welcome. 

Pulling of documentation is pretty fast and painless. Usually somebody goes over
your text and merges it, since there are no "breaks" and that GitHub parses rst
files automagically it's really convenient to work with.

Also, contributing to the documentation will earn you great respect from the
core developers. You get good karma just like a test contributor, but you get
double cookie points. Seriously. You rock.

Section style
=============

We use Python documentation conventions fo section marking:

* ``#`` with overline, for parts
* ``*`` with overline, for chapters
* ``=``, for sections
* ``-``, for subsections
* ``^``, for subsubsections
* ``"``, for paragraphs

Translations
************

For translators we have a `Transifex account
<http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/django-filer-gallery/>`_ where you can translate
the .po files and don't need to install git or mercurial to be able to
contribute. All changes there will be automatically sent to the project.
